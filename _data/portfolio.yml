      This logo is a modern take on the original Winnipeg Jets logo from the early 1970's. I submitted it to a contest on puckdrawn.com resulting in first place finish. When Winnipeg officially got their team back, my logo was thought to be the new leaked logo. This design was also featured on yahoo.com's front page as best fan-made Winnipeg Jet logo.

    This robust system was coded to generate multiple online banking themes within 40 hours. I took the existing framework and detangled the CSS making it so everything could be changed by using variables.  The current framework in place was very complex, anitiquated and didnt offer the kinda of customization options that the customers were needing. My system pushed the framework to the limits (Gotham theme is shown) and provided a solution that the clients were asking for.
